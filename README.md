To get started, you need to copy the *release* branch of the repository
```
$ git clone --branch release https://github.com/Finka95/Warehouse.git
```

If you are using a unique connection string to your mssql database, you should specify it in the Warehouse/appsettings.json file in the MsSqlConnection field
```
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "MsSqlConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=warehouse;Trusted_Connection=True;"
  }
```
letâ€™s build and test the project
```
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

If there is no problem at the last stage, you need to publish and run the project.
```
dotnet publish
dotnet ~\Warehouse\Warehouse\bin\Debug\net7.0\publish\Warehouse.dll
```
By default the project is launched at http://localhost:5000 .
You can use the http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html to access swagger and all endpoints.
Or you can use Postman.
